# Hospital-network-Design

This report describes the network design of Health care management or Hospital.
In this network topology the nodes (i.e., computers, switches, routers or other devices) are connected to a local area network (LAN) and network via links (twisted pair copper wire cable or optical fiber cable). We have used Cisco Packet Tracer for designing the network topology It's a general design which can be implemented at any higher level to manage network system.
